Hi IT,

 

Our lab has developed a web app for genomic data resource. We are applying to setup a VM and test the web app internally and eventually publish to the multi-omic community outside BCM. I am summarizing the specifications for the VM, and the public facing domain will be below.

 

https://XXX.research.bcm.edu

 

Below are the resources might be needed for the VM.

 

1. OS: Redhat Linux 8
2. Core: 8-core
3. RAM: 32GB RAM
4. Hard drive: 200GB Storage
5. Admin users:
- Full name: BCM_ECA@bcm.edu
- Holder, Christopher Michael: Christopher.Holder@bcm.edu
6. Ports to open: port 80 and port 443.
For public admin, we might redirect HTTP to HTTPs.
7. We don't need to preinstall any database. We will set up web service by ourselves using cellxgene (https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) after our accounts have been granted admin access.

 

Thank you so much for your help.

```
