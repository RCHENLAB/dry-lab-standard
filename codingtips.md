When it comes to defining a good wrapper and decorations for Python code, there are a few key principles to keep in mind:

* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - Avoid duplicating code or functionality across different parts of your codebase.

* Separation of Concerns - Break your code down into small, reusable modules that each handle a single responsibility.

* Error Handling - Write code that can handle errors gracefully and provide clear, informative error messages.

* Logging - Use logging to help debug your code and track down issues.

* Documentation - Write clear and concise documentation for your functions and modules. Never forget to put the test case!


With these principles in mind, here are some tips for creating a good wrapper and decorations for Python code: Use decorators to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code. This can be a powerful way to add logging, error handling, or other functionality to your codebase. Create separate modules for related functionality. For example, you might have a module for data processing, another for machine learning models, and another for visualization. Use object-oriented programming principles to create reusable classes that encapsulate related functionality. Use logging to help debug your code and track down issues. Python's built-in logging module is a great tool for this. Write clear and concise documentation for your functions and modules. This will help other developers understand how to use your code and contribute to it.

```
# Generic wrapper

def my_wrapper(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # do something before the function is called
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # do something after the function is called
        return result
    return wrapper

@my_wrapper
def my_function():
    # function code here


#To create  a new function that calls an existing Python function
```


There is other example:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Script to preprocess scRNAseq data
# Author: Wong
# Date: [insert date]

# Use consistent indentation
trap debug

# Define input and output directories
INDIR=/storage/singlecell/jinli/wkfl/atlashumanprj/pubdata/cellqcrun/Wong/cellqcoutdir
OUTDIR=./pubdata/preproc/Wong/scrnah5ad2clean

# Define list of observations to extract
OBSERVATIONS=(DF.classification s nCount_RNA nFeature_RNA pANNpercent.mtsc pred_prediction)

# Define function to process each input file
function process_file {
    local file=$1
    local basename=$(basename "$file" .h5ad)

    # Check if file exists
    if fileexists.sh "$file"; then
        # Use descriptive variable names for options
        local options=$(basharr2cmdopts.sh -o -s -- "${OBSERVATIONS[@]}")

        # Use a try-catch block to catch errors from slurmtaco.sh
        # and print an error message if it fails
        set +e
        slurmtaco.sh -t 2 -m 20G -- scrnah5ad2clean.sh -r -d "$OUTDIR" -b "$basename" -v $options -- "$file"
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "Error: Failed to preprocess $file"
        fi
        set -e
    else
        echo "Error: File $file not found"
    fi
}
```
We can use this:

```
# Use descriptive variable names for external dependencies
source env_parallel.bash
```

Or alternativaly, this:
```
# Process each input file using process_file function
# Use a for loop instead of env_parallel for simplicity
for file in "$INDIR"/*.h5ad; do
    process_file "$file"
done

```
